PCFKeypad is a library written for the arduino. It allows users of multi-button matrix keypads to utilize the pad with the NXP PCF8574AP I2C I/O expander.

Currently it only supports 4 row, 3 col keypads but could be easily adopted to work with other size/types of pads.

Please read the documentation in the PCFSerial example for wiring instructions.
